324 FAMILIAE mmmm GENTIUM. MS.142

&rathma—Rome.

The beginning of this pedimee is taken from Mrs Shaw's ‘ Tombstone‚⁷ a
biographioal work on the life of ΜΝ Dorothy shaw. That George Heathcote who
mar. Lydia Clarke was her nephew is assumed 011 conjecture. Of bei· four brothers
one only was living in 1657, who had been a Captain in the Army, and was then in
Ireland. I can hardly suppose that, he was the George who mar. Lydia Clarke, and
it is evident that he was not one of the other three. But liis possession of the
Estate at Cutthorp and similarity of religious belief shews that he was a relation of
Ml*¹ Shaw.
