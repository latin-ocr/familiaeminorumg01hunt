. Μ’ John Milnes writes thus : John Lee, a barber ab Sheffield-it was called ‘⁴ The
Whig News- Sliop ’'—took in 1116 Whig Newspapers of those days. By his 11151 wife
he had John Lee who was put apprentiee 10 a Cloth Merchant ut 1166115111ν his second
wife, <5⁶ supplied by her with a Cupit-al 011 establishing himself as a 1116161111111 111 that
town. This second wife, 'oy whom there was no issue. was a (1116-«11 Auni of 1116
second Samuel 511016, dau. of Mary Shore afterwards Milues, mother of Mt John
Milnes, who sa5s that he remeinbered pertraits of this John Lee S: 11115 second wife,
whom the old folks of that day used to call uncle ὣ Aunt Lee when deseribing 1116
old family pictures. ΜΓ 31111165 says 116 had ’11115 account from his late Uncle Shore,
3: has heard them confirmed by John Lee the lawyer.

This pedigree 1105 ’06611 prineipally coxnpiled by myself from informabion 6011-
tained amongst 1116 Milnes’ papers. Η* 11111165 was informed that 1116 11665 of
Chesterfield were of 1116 same stoek, So the Wards, whose pedigree is 311 page , bave
a tradition thal: their aneestor Miss Lee was of 1116 same family with those at
Chesterfield.

I believe the Attorney-General is wrongly placed, Sc that. he was son of Thomas
82 Margaret, 11111 111611 116 could 1101 have been b. in 1733]ιι

h They are also supposed 10 be related 10 1116 Shores. (See will ofLydia Wrightof
S effield.)

Mr Milnes interposes a John Lee, the 11151 5611161· ab Leeds, father of Th0⁵, ὦ Ι

have no confidence in 1116 children of this John Lee being of 1116 Leeds family ab all.

The whole matter 15 very obscure.
