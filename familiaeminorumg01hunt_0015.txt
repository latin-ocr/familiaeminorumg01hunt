vi PREFACE.

The Council of the Harleian Society has now decides] to print it in
full, considering that the members and others interested in Genealogy

should have the opportunity of always being able to obtain the infor-
matiou it contains.

The manuscript has been copied by ΜΓ. Α. H. Heppell, and the
Editor has caret'ully compared the transcript with the original, as well as
most of the proof sheets. Those who are acquainted with ΜΓ, ermn’s
handwriting·‚ especially in his later years, will sympathize with the
copyist and the Editor in their tasks, as many words are so written
that they can be very variously deciphered3 the greatest difficulty has
been found in the Proper names of persons, where no reference is easily
attainabk, and of small places not in a Guzetteer. Many thunks are due
to Mr. Bickley of the Munuscript Room in the British Museun] for his

help in clearing up the meaning of some of the most puzzling words.

It has been thought advisuble to make as an exact· a copy as possible,
and not to alter or continue the pedigrecs, but a few footnotes have been
given to correct any manifest errore, and also to add some further entries
fron] the Northowram and other Purish Registers which might throw
further light on the subject. The pagination of the MS. is also given,
so that ΜΓ. HUNTER’S references to other pedigrees can be easily found.

It, is proposed to complete the Work in four volumes, and to print the
Index in the concluding one.
