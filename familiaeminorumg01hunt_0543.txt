It has happened to this family to have become connected with three persons who
employed themselves in topographical A* genealogieal inquiries, viz.. John Brooke„ the
Reotor of High 1101111111, John Chai-les Brwke. Esq„ Soiiieiset Herald. who was a
great-grandson of Mary, wife of William Brooke, aud John Wilson of Blwmheud,
Esq. They all (lid something for the pedigire, ἃ their collections have been usedin
these three pagos, but there is a living member of the family who has laboured more
effectually than any of [hem to bring together the evidenees ᾧ to compile the
pedigree. This is Mr Edward (lates, son of ‚loseph Oates, Esq.‚ ou the next page
I was the nie-ons of obtaining for him acet-ss to the evidenees of [his family in the
Collectiou of the late ΜΓ wilm), ὰ these tirrmed the principal authority¹ for the elder
generations when he registered this pedigree 111 1116 College of Arms. This he did
about the year 1815, when a grant of Coat-armour was made to all the descendants
of ,Ioseph Oates ὣ Mary Fentou. This was said to be the most extensive grant that
the late Earl Μαι-511111 allowed to pass, & he was induc-ed to pass it iu consequence
of having been person-any acquainted with Mr Hamer Oates when his Grace com-
manded the West York Militia. Before that time the family had used Or or Argent,
2 bends azure, a canton ermine. which are the Arms of the old family of Fitz-Othes.
These are given to them in Warburton's Map. What they now bear may be seen in
‘ Loidis and Elmete‚' where is a good pedigree, prineipally of the Leeds branch of
the family, eommunicated to that work by Mr Edward Oates. The substance of
that pedigree is here transeribed, but many important matters will here be found iu
addition. 1 hare followed throughout the pedigree as finally settled by my friend
ΜΙ Edward Oates July, 1821.
