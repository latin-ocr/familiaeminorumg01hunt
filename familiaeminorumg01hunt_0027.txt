Joim Wilson, d. 1760. Α1111 Wilson, went to reside in London.

The account contained in this and the following pages of the descendants of
Joshua Kirby, the ejected Cambden Lecturer of Wakefield, is taken for 1110 most:
part from the memoirs of him and his family compiled in the year 1760 by
Dr. sutton of Leicester, one of his descendants. Two copies of Dr. Sutton's MSS.
have been used; 0110 the property of Α1115. Milnes of Fryston in Yorkshire. an Svo
of 143 pag-es with 25 of additions. This was for some time in my hand. The
other was the property of Sir Wadsworth Busk. Of this my late friend ΜΓ. 1101111,
of Wiekersley in Yorkshire made a transcript, which has been compared with
Mr. Milnes⁷ Mss. Ι have made a few additions, prinoipally from the MSS. of
Mr. Oliver Heywood and ΜΓ. Thomas Diekenson.

Mr. Kirhy‘s rhymes were valued by his family, and I find that ΜΓ. O. Heywood,
who was his friend, transcribed many of 1110111 for his own use. The following may
501·νο as a specimen, and be at the same time a proof of 1110 Genealogy as far
as it oroes :—

ὗ Mary did wisely choose the better part
Susanna did her own to Chrisn impari:
Elz'zabetlz religionsly did live
Plzaebe did suocour unto many give
Camdena of my foundress remindeth me
Welcome expresses what a child should be
Godsffl'st both fathers names may bear and spread
Tulin is the living monument of my dead
Joshna rejoiceth in his Savionr's name, Believeth,
Preacheth and suffers for the same.
