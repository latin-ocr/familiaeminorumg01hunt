The roll, of which this is a copy, appears 'to have been the family tree. as I have
heard such records called. Ic was probably usual in families who possessed one to
have it transcrihed from time to time winh such addicions as time had produced.
The transcript, from which this is a copy was made afner the birbh of Winifred &a
before her marriage, therefore about: 1730. It may fairly be taken as good authority
for the descendants of her great-grandfather Nicholas M„ Rector of Sc. Saviour⁷s.
