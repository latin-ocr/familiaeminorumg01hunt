Tm: Rssv. JOSEPH Huxrmae, F.S.A.‚ the Historian of Hallamshire and
South Yorksliire, was born at Shefficld 6 February 1783, being the son of
Michael Hunter, a cutler. His mother dying early, he was placed under
the guardianship of the Rev. Joseph Evans, a Presbyterian Minister, who
sent him to a school at Sheffleld. Iu 1805 he began to study for the
Ministry under the Rev. Charles Wellbeloved at York, and in 1809
became the Minister of an Unitarian Congregation at Bath. From an
early period he devoted himself to antiquarian pursuits, and particularly
to the history of his native county. He published in 1819 the ‘ History
of Hallanishire‚' and in 1828 and 1831 the ‘ History of South Yorkshire,'
which latter work may perhaps be considered one of the best county
histories in existence. In 1833 he was appointed a Sub-Commissioner
and in 1838 Ass-istaut Keeper of Public Records. From that time he
lived in London, where he died 9 May 1861, and was buried in Ecclesfield
Churchyard.

A-fter his death a large number of his Manuscripts became the property

- of the British Museum. They are numbered Add. MSS. ‘24‚436—630‚

24,864—885‚ 25,459-481‚ 25,676—7, 31,021.

Without a doubt the most important of these is Add. MS. 24‚458,
which he entitled “ Familiae Minorum Gentinm‚'’ though it is doubtful
whether the title is a happy one.

It is a thick folio volume of some 650 pages completely filled with
pedigrees, chiefly of Yorkshire‚ Derbyshire, Cheshire, and Lancashire
families, though of course their branches extend over other counties.
Mr. HUNTER, by reason of his large genealogical acquaintance and also of
his connection with the leading Unitarian families of the day, had the
opportunity of gathering together such a mass of information that this
book has perhaps been as much consulted as any work of a similar
character in the Museum.
