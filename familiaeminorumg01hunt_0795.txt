This pedigree was communicated to M* Samuel Heywood of Nottingham, when
he was collecting for the genealogy of his family in 1781, by Μ’ Peter ‚John
Heywood, then residing at Whitehaven. The earlier generations have the appear-

added the description and marriage of Oaptain Peter Heywood‚ who is well known
to my wife's family. The conjecture that John Heywood, first of the family at
p. 26, was son to Thomas is founded on proximity of residence, combined with
what Oliver Heywood has recorded that he was by tradition descended of the
Heywoods of Heywood, aud that old ΜΓ Robert Heywood of H. called his father
cousm.
