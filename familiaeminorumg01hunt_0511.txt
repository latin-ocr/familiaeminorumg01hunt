This is indeed the most interesting part of the Pedigree, the rest being for the
most part to be found in printed works. Those generations Ι apprehend never ap-
peared in any publication. 1101· were they ever entered ac the Colle-ge of Arm& Yam

some account of the Mortons of Dorsetshire iu the ⁶ Baronetage' of1720‚ agreeihg
with the account here given. No descendants remam of Winifred Milnes.

This is Brailsford's pedigree of Bagshaw with conninuations. He thus actests
itz “ This from a copy and some papers in the custody of William Bagshaw of
Ford 3 a great: part, whereof Ι have examined by some aged neighbours thereabout
and is truth.'‘

But the earlier desceuts are taken from a ‘Visitation of Staffordshim, 1583:
certified by Nicholas Bagshaw, with the Arms as usually borne. It contains his 2
dau³, the 2¹³³ of whom in my copy, Harl. 1995, f. 57, is called Nazareth. His
brothers are stated: Edward, william, Osmund, ὣ Thomas, No wife given to
Edward. Ι very much doubt Brailsford‘s deduction of Wffl B. of Hueklow from
that Edward. The time does not allow so many generations.
