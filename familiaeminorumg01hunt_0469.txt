MS. 101 FAMILIAE mxomm GENTIUM. 223

‘⁴ The oldest 111-111113 which I can understand is a grant of 1110 lands and Manor
of Barloy 1100115 scats from Marjory (10 L ι1101110 10 Wffl (10 11( ι·0 of 11101 place. Fro ιιι]
this ph1as e k from the extent, of 1110 3ι,ιιιι1 being six or seven miles irom Eas 1 to
W‚est Ι suspect that this was rather an extension of an old than ιι ncw grant. An
extension of privileges Ι should take 11 10 be, for 1110 fec simple of all the lands
within the boundary there described they never did nor could possess This dced
is dated 34 Edw ardy IIL'y

In a later 0011110001οι111011 10 M 11111005, 31³ Mower says 11101, 5110 has since
found among 1110 family papers many decds with ;ι111 (1-ι1105 which she supposes, and
rightly, to be of an eai lier age than this of Marjory (10 Leheme. Ι (10 1101 find that
any absh-acts have been made of them. One was of the De Οι1115(ἶ ) family with
