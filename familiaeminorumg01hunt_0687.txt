¹ Dionysia must have been a first wife of Nicholas, S: had by him Thomas her
son & heir, of whom Ι perc-eive no further mention. She was dead 33 Eliz., when
the Inq. p.m. of her father was taken 1590. Ι now am persuaded that Thomas Stead
was the person of that name from whom the Steads of Comber descmded, as at
p. 268. Yet it seems N. S. m. Dionis T. 22 June 1580.
