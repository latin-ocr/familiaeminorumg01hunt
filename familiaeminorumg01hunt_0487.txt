The earlier generations on this page are copied from O. 40, f. 13:213. in the
. College of Arms. Ι think there were few persons who appeared at the Visitation
who had less pretence to gentility than the two Francis Mortons, cousins. They

1 From this william the Mortons of Canvers, antiently Moldieliffe. are supposed

to have sprung. They ended in Richard zlorton of Canyers, who left only 7 ἀπ’,
