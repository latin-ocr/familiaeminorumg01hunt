This is wrong.

It seems not improbable that he was the John Pole or Pooless
John son of Geor-ge of Spink·hill. of Killamarsh.

But it 15 wrong.

From the Deanery Books at York‚ I find that the will of Francis Poole of Eccles-
field was proved by Francis and John Po‹,)le 1115 Executors, 5 July 1722.

Concerning the Morphys I have seen the br'ief m a cause Lord George Howard
against Riehard Revel S: other Defendants who had 1155151511 Edmund Morphy' ln an
escape from the Bailiff of Hallams hire when arrested ab the suib of said Lord
Georgo for Εῦὸ. Τ1115 uas in 1695. He complains that he had lost all chance of

recovering his debt.
