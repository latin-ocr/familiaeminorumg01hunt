I have taken this pains not for the present age, but a future.
Many things which were known to our grandsires are lost to us3
and our grandchildren will search in vain for many facts Which

to us are most familiar.

Parvula (nam exemplo est) magni formica laboris
Ore trahit quodeunque potest atque addit acervo
Quem struin hand ignaru ao nou incanta futuri.

He heapeth up riehes and knoweth not who shall guther them.

Scribuntur lime in generatione alterii.
Ps. cii. v. 18.

The Raee of Man is one vast marshalled army
Sumnioned to pass the spaeious realms of Time
Their leader the Almighty.

See the vain Race of Mortals move
Like Shadows o'er the Plain,

They rage aud strive‚ desire and love,
But all the Noise is vain,

Some walk in Honour's gaudy Show,
Some dig for golden Ore,

They toil for Heirs they know not who,
And strait are seen no more.

Transivere patres ; simul et transibimus omnes ;
At coeium patriam, qui bene transit, habet.

The busy tribes of fiesh and blood
With all their hopes and fears
Are carried downward by the flood
And lost in following years.

Like flowery fields the nations stand
Pleased with the morning light ;

The flowers beneath the niower's hand
Lie withering ere 'tis night.
