¹ It appears by a Composition on account. of Reousanoy that in 1632 the wife
of this Rowland Revell was named Paith, a former marriage I presume, ὦ that
Bridget was the issue of thar marriage. This Ι conclude because she was older
than the rest. Has a distinct mention in her father's will, and is nob mentioned
with her sistens in Lucy Percy's will.
