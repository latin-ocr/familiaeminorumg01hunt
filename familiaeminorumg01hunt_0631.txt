It was to him that M‘8 Edmnnds left the ,1:10 a year charged 011 the Leiccstershire
Estate, S: to his son that the estate itselt' was left. He was living at Nottingham in
1672 when Thoroton published. His wife was Ann, dau. of Francis Tilman of
Kent. By her he had Nicholas. Gervas, and Ann, according* to Thoresby. Vincent
now fails us, bnt Brailsford begins to be more particular and interesting. To the
three children he adds 3 fourth maye, woman to Madam Ann Pierrepoint, mar. to

walton, co. Leic. The two 5005 Nicholas and Gervas had both issue.

Nicholas was living at Nottingham in 1700 when he granted a lease of the estate

Kettleby estate. ὣ 111 1785 made her will. As by that will this estate passed to the
descendants of her uncle Gervas Strelley. I conclude that she was the last surviving

Gervas was also of thtincham. He mar. Ann, dau. of Thomas Balgny of Astom,

had 3 daughter and heir Mary who was twice married, first to . . . . Denham, and 2⁰1¹&

and Bartholomew Frost were the issue, and they have lately sold the estate at
