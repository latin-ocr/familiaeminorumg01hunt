There is some uncertainty about Alexander Hatfidd, son of John H. of Hatfiehl.
In D¹' Benson's Registcr we find Sufanua Hatficld, daughter of ΜΓ Alexander
Hatfield, a tide-imiter, who lived in Horn Court, Beni· Lane, near Thanies stret-t,
in parish of All Hallows Barking, and Elizabeth his wife, b. 15 Sep„ bp. 12 oct,

The great question is who was the father of Nieholas Ρ Dugdale has entered two
pedigrees of Hatfiold in C. 40, containing different accounts. One states that he
was the son of stophen Hatfield ot* Hatfield in Hoderness, to whom Wil . . . . Floxver
granted the Arms in 1563. This is the enti-y made by the Hatfields of Langhton.
But when Captain ,John Hatfield made an entry he deduced his desoent from
Adam de Hatfield of Hatfield in Glossopdale.
