The great authority f01 this page is the pedigree which the family enteied az
Dngdale's Visitation,1666. Many (lates ale added fron] the paris h Regis [er of
Laughton. Some of the latter parts are from the information of M* Monlt who
knew the family, cz by 311⁵ Emis-jhc of Sheffield, a dan. of W eztby Hatfield, who being
much reduced ιιι his eir‹.·nmstances was an the time of his death Ma5ter of the noys
Charity School ιιι §hethi—ld. The Monumems of Laughton &- Ha[field have supplied
some particulars, ἃ· I have had the use of a pedigree which seemed to have been
compiled about 1770 by one of the family, which contained the marriages of
Anthony Hatfield's children.
