The accounts of the early generations of this family in publio 32 private
Collections of Genealogy vary, as may be seen hy comparing this pedigree with that
given in ⁴ Hallainsliire,' p. 2:3⁶. Here Ι have followed [he pedigree entered at the
Visitation of 11102. Ι11 ·’ Hallaulshire ' Ι have given the deseent as it was understood
to be by ΜΓ. Blore, who followed. as Ι believe, an account of the family which was
111 the possession of Edward ssurtou of Chesterfield‚ S: probably compiled by his
relation Michael Burtou of Holmesfield, who appears to have had a, turn for these
anquiries. A copy of that pedigree Ι remember to have seen among Μ’ Wilson's

ollections.

The additions to the Visitation pedigree both on the right S: left hand have
been made by M* Blore ἃς myself from the usual authorities, and Ι make no doubt
that they will stand the test of future investigation. The most material point in
the additions of William of Holinesfield below, who is entirely omitted (as well as
Godfrey) in the Visitation perlici-ee of 1662. Ι know· not whether he appe-urs in
that of 16:34. The monumental inscription of this william still exists among the
other Burtous in the Chureh of Dronfidd, and the memorial which is transcrihed
> in the next column shows a relationship between his descendants ὣ the family of
Thomas of Fanshaw Gate.
