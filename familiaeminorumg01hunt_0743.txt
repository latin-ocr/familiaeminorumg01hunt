This account of the descendants of Matthew Hemy, whose ‘ Exposition ' on 1110
Scriptures has long been 50 popular among the Non-Conformists, is taken from the
pedigree in Ormerod's ⁶ (Jheshirc,v aided by what is contained in the printed life of
ΜΓ Henry, ἃ by infieration given ine by his tumul-daughter Mrff Eddowes. The
descendants of his four 5151015 I received fron] Mt Bntchcr, who, it will bc seen, 111111.

Henry. Of the four 5151015 it 11111 110 50011 that 1110 descendants of Sarah are very
numerous, while there is only family (xic) sprung from each of the other sister‘s, viz,
the Lighthodys from Catherine, the Rogers froin Eleanor, S: the Hultons from Anne.
